Collect candies and get ranked, the top ranked users will get goodies from myself at the end of the event in **November 5th, 3PM EDT**.\n - `p!trade box @someone` Use this to award boxes to someone.\n - `p!lootbox` Check the lootboxes in your inventory, Event Boxes are opened responding with `open EV`.\n\nAny further questions, bugs, or anything.
